# Data that I wrote
This is a collection of files that I have spent a long time writing because I couldn't find anybody who has done them before on the internet.

Maybe you'll find something useful, maybe you won't. I know I have. 

I wrote these files for my own purposes, and so some have very specific bits of information. Most of these files have been written to be used by [my Discord bot](https://github.com/KetchupChips1/YeeBot). They may not be perfect for your use, but just be happy that at least one person has already done most of the work for you if you do actually need one of these files.
